A proposal clearly defines how and why an index component across the five main domains of Dijets Ecosystem should be changed and ensures that this improvement is introduced in a responsible way, respecting the highest quality, security and standards.</p></li><li><p><strong>DIP0:</strong> The genesis DIP defining the DIPs framework. This DIP defines all of the processes that are required for the implementation of future DIPs. </p></li><li><p><strong>DIP Sets:</strong> A DIP set is a group of several DIPs that are interdependent, wherein without the entire set of DIPs existing, individual DIPs in the Set become inconsistent, invalid or uncomprehensive. The intention is for DIP sets to together describe a single complex behaviour in such a way that allows each individual DIP to be written following the principle of Specificity but work together as a single cohesive unit.</p></li><li><p><strong>DIP Domains:</strong> DIPs are separated into the Ecosystem&#x27;s five main domains of:</p><ul><li>Network &amp; Protocol</li><li>Governance Models</li><li>Metaverse</li><li>Money Markets and</li><li>Products &amp; Services. </li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Process DIP:</strong> Process DIPs are used to create and define a specific recurring process that Dijets Governance will implement. This very document is a Process DIP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subproposals (SPs):</strong> A subproposal is an instance of a sub-process that has been defined by a specific DIP. Subproposals are named in the following format: DIP0-SP1 (where DIP0 is a Process DIP and DIP0-SP1 is a subproposal under that Process DIP)  </p></li><li><p><strong>Governance Arbiter(s):</strong> Governance Arbiters are tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities, anything from general administration to governance scheduling.

DIPs with many different behaviours or responsibilities will not be allowed and must be split up into multiple DIPs.<ul><li>This mitigates the risk of having “fine print” or potential attacks hidden in large, complex technical DIPs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Completeness:</strong> A DIP or DIP Set is complete if it has all the necessary or appropriate parts that cover a whole behaviour and avoids being only a specific part of a greater whole.<ul><li>This is important for both understandability, readability and accessibility of DIPs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Avoid overlap:</strong> Multiple DIPs should not implement the same type of behaviour independently. For instance, there should not be two separate but interchangeable ways to onboard core personnel.<ul><li>This way the primary and best-understood process for each particular behaviour will be fairly available to all the members equally, without risking having a knowledge gap that makes it possible for one member with better access to information to use different and potentially better processes</li></ul></li><li><strong>Clarity:</strong> A DIP must not have equally valid conflicting interpretations. DIP Authors and DIP Editors must strive to reduce ambiguity. A DIP must be as clear and easy to understand as possible.<ul><li>Any ambiguous DIPs are likely to cause contention or confusion in the future. Making everything as clear as possible also aids readability and helps to mitigate security risks.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Brevity:</strong> A DIP must be as short as possible, including only that which is essential given the other core principles.<ul><li>The shorter the DIPs are the more likely it is for people to read them in full. This also serves to reduce the surface area for hidden attacks.</li></ul></li></ol><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dip0m3-the-dip-lifecycle">DIP0m3: The DIP Lifecycle<a class="hash-link" href="#dip0m3-the-dip-lifecycle" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>The DIP Lifecycle Flow and DIP Statuses</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="DIPs Lifecycle" src="/docs/assets/images/dip-lifecycle-2dbbc443d0953b5e9f5eaba362c73827.svg" width="922" height="408" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>1. Conception:</strong> The lifecycle of a DIP begins when the DIP proposal is posted on <a href="https://forum.dijets.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dijets forum</a>. However, in order for a DIP to move to the next stage, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria (1) described below:</p><ul><li>Submitted to the Dijets Forum under DIPs Section.</li><li>Submitted to the DIPs Github repository (DIP Editor can submit a pull request for this).</li><li>The format must follow the appropriate DIP Template for its type.</li><li>DIPs must be original or replacement versions of older DIPs (No repeats allowed).</li></ul><p><strong>2. Approved by DIP Editor:</strong> This phase of a DIP’s life cycle is when the DIP Editor confirms that the proposed DIP follows the correct structure and editorial criteria defined in the DIP template. If the criteria is not met, the DIP Editor will provide an explanation to the authoring member as to why and allow them to make the appropriate changes before reconsideration. If the criteria have been met, the DIP Editor performs the following actions:</p><ul><li>The DIP is approved by a DIP Editor and is assigned a formal DIP number.</li><li>The PR is merged in by a DIP Editor.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Request for Comments (RFC):</strong> This phase is when a DIP goes through a formal review period, including feedback from the rest of the members, further drafting and additions.</p><ul><li>The authoring member finalises changes to the DIP, based on other members feedback.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Qualification: </strong>The timeline for the RFC phase is defined by its and Frozen Period. In order to move to the next phase, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria listed below:</p><ul><li>DIPs must not have had any changes for a minimum of 24 hours before they move to the next phase.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Formal Submission (FS):</strong> This phase is when the authoring members submit their complete DIP(s) to the Governance cycle by posting it to the formal submission forum category within the formal submission window of a governance cycle.</p><ul><li>A DIP can be re-submitted to the formal submission process a maximum of 2 additional times (3 total), without having to go through phase 1-3 again, if it failed to pass due to legitimate external reasons (e.g. subject to the governance Arbiters judgement).</li></ul><p><strong>6. Approved by the Governance Arbiter(s):</strong> This phase is when the DIP must be formally approved by the Governance Arbiters.   </p><ul><li>Once approved by the Governance Arbiter, the DIP will be included in the inclusion poll of the Voting cycle.</li><li>If the DIP is not approved by the Governance Arbiter, it may be reconsidered at a later date to enter the Voting cycle.
</li></ul><p><strong>7. Voting Cycle:</strong> This phase is when the DIP becomes officially available for voting. Determined by the DGC Members votes, the DIP is ultimately accepted or rejected.  </p><p><strong>7. Consensus Reached:</strong> DGC Members votes are tallied and the results are published.</p><p><strong>9. Accepted/Rejected:</strong> If accepted, the DIP is officially accepted and is given the accepted status and published to the official DIPs Directory. If the voting fails to pass before expiring, the DIP is rejected.</p><p><strong>Other DIP Statuses:</strong>  </p><p><strong>Withdrawn:</strong> when a DGC Member withdraws their DIP proposal, such as when:</p><ul><li>A DIP may be withdrawn at any point before it enters the Voting cycle. </li><li>Note that a withdrawn proposal can be taken over from the original DGC Member with a simple transition facilitated by a DIP Editor. If the original authoring member ceases to be available, the DIP Editor may proceed with the transfer of Authorship and the resultant HAL scores.</li></ul><p><strong>Obsolete:</strong> when a proposal is no longer used or is out of date, such as:</p><ul><li>A DIP has been replaced by a newer, more updated DIP Proposal.</li><li>A DIP Author has abandoned the proposal and no other member has communicated willingness to take over the Authoring responsibility.</li><li>A DIP no longer makes sense to keep in consideration.</li></ul><p><strong>DIP Status Change Process:</strong></p><p>DIP Editor reviews the DIPs directory to see if any of the DIPs meet the status criteria for a status change. If it does, the Editor will change the status of the DIP and the Author is notified along with the directory being updated. Status change request can also be made by the members to the DIP Editor.</p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dip0m4-dip-modules-and-dip-module-types">DIP0m4: DIP Modules and DIP Module Types<a class="hash-link" href="#dip0m4-dip-modules-and-dip-module-types" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>DIP Modules</strong></p><ul><li>When necessary, DIPs can have multiple modules if it needs to contain multiple units of logic to satisfy completeness.

Subproposals go through the DIPs process in the same way that DIPs do. The template, and frozen period for a set of subproposals are defined using a DIP module known as a Process module. Any DIP containing a Process Module gains the Process type.</p></li><li><p>The subproposal naming convention is DIP<strong>X</strong>m<strong>Y</strong>-<strong>SPZ</strong> where X is the parent DIP containing a module and Y is the Module that contains the subproposal template. This is important in order to delineate between different types of subproposals defined within the same DIP under different Process modules.
